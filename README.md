# Flappy-Bird-RL-DQN

A deep Q-learning agent that plays Flappy Bird using PyTorch.
A mini project, this flappy bird manage to pass thru one pipe most of the time.
I spent 3-4 hours training it with these hyperparameters that work for me.
I learnt a lot from this, what is RL, PyTorch(I still like Tensorflow though), Q-learning, DQN, Gymnasium, practical RL knowledge on other DL problems in real-life situations like shopping cart.

## How to run

1. Clone/download the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the notebook:
   jupyter notebook Flappy-Bird-DQN-RL.ipynb
4. Run Cell 1, 2, and 4
5. Cell 3 is optional, just for testing after training the model.
6. If you would like to train the model from the beginning, uncomment is_training=False in cell 2 and make it True then run Cell 1 and 2.
